# 1. Dice Rolling Simulator

# The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program 
# that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose 
# a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number 
# of sides on the die is up to you.) The program will print what that number is.
# It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll 
# need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, 
# that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that 
# randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

# import the random function

# declare the minimum and maximum values of the die faces
dice_min = __
dice_max = __

# write a function to simulate rolling the dice using the random.randint() function
# then print the number on the dice
def _____:
    dice_face = ____
    print()
    return

# declare a boolean to ask if user wants to play again
# we want it to be initially true to simulate a "do-while" loop
play_again = True

# while loop to simulate rolling the dice
while ____:
    # call our roll_dice() function
